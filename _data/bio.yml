  bio: >
    Irish lass turned code wizard, mother of chaos, and AI whisperer. When I'm not wrangling code, I'm probably chasing after my four-legged furball or losing myself in a good book. 
    
    Knock knock! Who's there? The AI that helps me spell! (It's true, my dyslexia and I are best friends with AI tech.)
  
  summary: >
    Full-stack developer with a theology degree and a penchant for creating user-friendly applications that make life easier for everyone. 
    
    When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
    - Brewing a perfect cup of tea
    - Snuggling with my dog
    - Debating the finer points of theology
    - Learning new programming languages
    - Laughing at my own jokes
    
    Fun fact: I once used AI to write a sermon about technology and faith. It was a hit... with the computers at least!
